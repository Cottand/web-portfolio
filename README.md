# Portfolio

This is a simple personal website written in React. It is hosted [on my own infra](https://github.com/Cottand/web-selfhosted)
I made it mostly to showcase my small portfolio of projects -- you can find each of them [here](src/assets/markdown/projects).

You can find the page deployed at [nico.dcotta.com](https://nico.dcotta.com).
