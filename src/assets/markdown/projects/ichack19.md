_ICHack_ is a Hackathon celebrated every year at Imperial College. I competed in a team of 6 and we won
the _Best Mobile App_ award.
Our submission, which we baptised ARnold, was an app that allowed a lecturer to bring 3D models to their
students' phones through AR.

We targeted medical and engineering students, who are often taught
complex models (say a plane turbine or a heart) and are often stuck with 2D, non interactive representations
of them. Even when they do get the chance to visualise a 3D model, it is not in a lecture, the most crucial
part of teaching.

We made the app with **Unity**, so in **C#**.
