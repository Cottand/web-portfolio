[Pintos](https://pintos-os.org/)
is an educational operating system for **`x86`** written in **C**, with features such as advanced scheduling, paging and virtual memory, and user programs, along with some of the `C` stdlib.

Developing Pintos required a deep understanding of the workings of an OS and the use of tools like `valgrind`, `gdb`, emulators, etc; as well as reading too much assembly!
