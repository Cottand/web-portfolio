I am largely a backend developer,
so making this website was a fun learning experience.

It is a simple static page that uses **React** and is written in **Typescript**.
It uses some convenience libraries for me to write these posts more easily, like
[react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
and
[react-syntax-highlighter](https://github.com/react-syntax-highlighter/react-syntax-highlighter).

The part I enjoyed the most about learning web development was Typescript's type system.
I find very few _popular_ (as in I can hope to work in it) backend languages
implement such strong and flexible type systems. 
Declaring type literals and structural type-checking
in particular were intuitive for me.
